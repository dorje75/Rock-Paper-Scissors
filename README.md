# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to my first web development project! This is a **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About the Project

The game allows you to play the classic Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent. It's simple, fun, and a great introduction to web development basics.

## Try It Out

To play, simply choose **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** and see if you can beat the computer. Good luck!
